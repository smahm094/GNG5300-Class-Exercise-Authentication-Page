 *This is a simple authentication page with user sign-up and login features. This was developed using django, python, html, css and mysql.*

 ## To run the server:

    Enter Password:******* (MySQL Password)

    CREATE DATABASE:
    * mysql> create database website;

    CREATE TABLE FOR THE DATABASE:
    * mysql> use website;
    * mysql> create table users(
         * > First_Name varchar(50) not null,
         * > Last_Name varchar(50) not null,
         * > Sex varchar(10) not null,

3. Modules:

    * Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    * Django (pip install Django)

    * You may need to download additional modules according to your system configuration.

    * When you will try to run the server and if your system do not meet the requirements, it will eventually tell you what other modules you may need to install.

    * To create a django admin user, please type: py manage.py createsuperuser

    * Steps to run:

        * Go to "localhost:8000/signup" to register
